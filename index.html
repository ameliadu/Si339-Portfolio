                                the way we see blue jeans. Their use of vintage denim and 
                                embroidery has made blue jeans a statement piece, rather than 
                                a mundane classic.

                                to classy. His use of the Gucci logo has redifined luxury fashion 
                                and has become a statement of luxury in today's millenials.
